# Clardy.eu Site

https://clardy.eu/

This is all of my code for my website.

It utilizes:
- NodeJS as the backend
- NGINX Reverse-Proxying to it
- ReactJS
- Angular 1.X
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

I used this to learn a bunch of things about NodeJS and some Javascript frameworks. My focus shifted away from this to Laravel and Vue as I started using it for work, so this hasn't been updated since my focus shifted.
